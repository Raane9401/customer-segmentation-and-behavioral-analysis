# 🚀 Customer Behavior Analysis –  Food Delivery Platform

This project delivers impactful exploratory data analysis (EDA) on user data from a Wolt-like food delivery service. It uncovers customer behavior trends, segments user types, and identifies key growth and retention insights over a 13-month period—from September 2019 to October 2020.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Understand user purchasing behavior and churn.
- Identify high-value vs. low-value customer segments.
- Propose actionable marketing and retention strategies.
- Estimate customer lifetime value (CLV).
- Visualize platform usage, cuisine preferences, and spending patterns.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and imputed missing values in fields like `first_purchase_date`.
- Added flags for users who made purchases.

### 2. Churn Rate Analysis
- ~45.28% churn rate identified.
- Suggested improvements in customer satisfaction and re-engagement tactics.

### 3. Time to First Purchase
- Majority of users ordered immediately after registration.
- Others waited days/weeks—highlighting need for onboarding nudges and timely promotions.

### 4. Platform Analysis
- Most users had low purchase counts.
- Web platform showed outliers—potential VIP/high-value users.

### 5. Purchase Behavior
- Most users placed small orders.
- A few placed many low-value orders—suggesting use for convenience or cheap items.

### 6. Customer Segmentation
Segmented users based on spend and frequency:
- **Low-Spend / Infrequent:** Welcome offers.
- **Low-Spend / Frequent:** Value bundles, loyalty passes.
- **High-Spend / Frequent:** VIP perks, fast delivery.
- **High-Spend / Infrequent:** Re-engagement offers.

### 7. CLV Estimation
- High-spend, frequent users generate the most value.
- Focus on converting high-spend infrequent users to loyal customers.

### 8. Cuisine Preference Analysis
- American cuisine dominates.
- Recommends diversification and personalized food suggestions.

## 📊 Sample Visualizations (in notebook)

- Churn rate donut chart.
- Time-to-first-purchase histogram.
- Platform usage bar plots.
- Customer segmentation scatter plots.
- CLV vs. frequency graphs.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
