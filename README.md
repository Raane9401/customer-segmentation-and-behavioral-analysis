## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and imputed missing values in fields like `first_purchase_date`.
- Added flags for users who made purchases.

### 2. Churn Rate Analysis
- ~45.28% churn rate identified.
- Suggested improvements in customer satisfaction and re-engagement tactics.

### 3. Time to First Purchase
- Majority of users ordered immediately after registration.
- Others waited days/weeks—highlighting need for onboarding nudges and timely promotions.

### 4. Platform Analysis
- Most users had low purchase counts.
- Web platform showed outliers—potential VIP/high-value users.

### 5. Purchase Behavior
- Most users placed small orders.
- A few placed many low-value orders—suggesting use for convenience or cheap items.

### 6. Customer Segmentation
Segmented users based on spend and frequency:
- **Low-Spend / Infrequent:** Welcome offers.
- **Low-Spend / Frequent:** Value bundles, loyalty passes.
- **High-Spend / Frequent:** VIP perks, fast delivery.
- **High-Spend / Infrequent:** Re-engagement offers.

### 7. CLV Estimation
- High-spend, frequent users generate the most value.
- Focus on converting high-spend infrequent users to loyal customers.

### 8. Cuisine Preference Analysis
- American cuisine dominates.
- Recommends diversification and personalized food suggestions.
